# educaseassignment - A Simple React Authentication App
## educaseAuth app is a basic React application that demonstrates user authentication. It consists of four main pages: Landing, Sign Up, Login, and Settings. Users can sign up, log in, view their profile information.

Landing Page: The landing page welcomes users and provides options to either log in or sign up.

Sign Up Page: Users can register with their name, number, email, password, and company name. After successful registration, they are redirected to the login page.

Login Page: Users can log in using their registered email and password. Upon successful login, they are redirected to the Settings page.

Settings Page: Users can view their username and email address in the Settings page. A "Log Out" button in the navigation bar allows users to log out.

Firebase Authentication: Firebase is used for secure user authentication. Passwords are securely stored and managed by Firebase.
